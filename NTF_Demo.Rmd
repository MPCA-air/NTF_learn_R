# Coming soon!

_(This slide looks like a cool movie poster)_

Data analysis and R training is on its way. 

Today will be a _flash_ preview of what R can do for you and what will be covered in the upcoming Fall training.

We are __Kristie__ and __Dorian__.  

We like __R__.

We are not "computer scientists". 

You will see us make mistakes. Feel free to laugh at us. It's okay.


# Top 10 _(+2)_ reasons to use R
> R is a computer language contributed to and maintained by people all around the world. Imagine 100s of graduate students providing you with tools to analyze and visualize your data, that is exactly what is happening RIGHT NOW. 
> Everyone will prioritize this list differently. Pay attention to the topics, not the order.

![](https://mpca-air.github.io/air-methods/images/cover.jpeg)


# 1| Dynamic tools

_It all started with a_ [Pollution Rose](https://shinyapps.io).
>We had lost our statistical software support, it took us months to process our air toxics data, and we saw this powerful way to automate our work. 

# 2| **IT'S FREE**

# Get R!

> R lets you perform data analysis like you're writing a recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Once you've written your favorite recipe you can use it over and over again and share it with your collaborators.

- __Prep 2:__ [Install R](https://mpca-air.github.io/NTF_learn_R/00_Install.html)


# 1| There is a package for you.
# Yelp! We've got new data.

> __First day on the job.__ 
>
> You are given a lap top with one folder on it. In the folder are two Excel files and the folder is named "the_data". On this first overwhelming day of work you also receive a phone call asking what you think of the data. The person on the other side of the phone call tells you that the data set isn't complete and will be updated on a weekly basis and there is a potential need for weekly data analysis updates. (you think briefly about your brother who sells ice cream on a beach and wonder what that would be like...).  
>
> The __MISSION IMPOSSIBLE__ begins. 


# R Packages

> When someone wants to share their recipe or add a new tool to R, they wrap everything together into a package. Packages in R are like Apps for your phone.
>
> Since the data is stored in an Excel file we can load the __readxl__ package to give R the power to read data from Excel.

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
```

# Load the data

> There are a series of commands within each package. Since we have an `.xlsx` file, we'll use the command `read_excel()`.

__Read in the Excel file and look at the tabs.__

For 2015:
```{r, eval=F}
data_2015 <- read_excel("data/PM_and_Ozone/Hourly_Fond_Du_Lac.xlsx", 
                        sheet = "2015")

```

For 2016:
```{r, eval=F}
data_2016 <- read_excel("data/PM_and_Ozone/Hourly_Fond_Du_Lac.xlsx",  
                        sheet = "2016")
```



# 2| Read all the rows####

# 3| Read online data
These two benefits of R go together. 
Excel is limited to around a million rows.
There is a lot of big and useful datasets stored online.
We can pull them straight into our Environment in R without taking up space on our hard drives or networks.



# 3| Join all the data tables with 1 line
instead of vlookup 100 times, one line to rule them all
(join concentration and met)

# Join data tables in R

> Since it looks like our data has the same format and only the year is changing, we can bind up the rows with `bind_rows()`.

```{r, eval=F}
air_data <- bind_rows(data_2015, data_2016)
```

> Now we've got all the concentration data together. But, it looks like our meteorological data came in separately.


# 4| Documentation and transparency
#To DO List
1. Analyze data
2. ?
__One of the best things about R is that you can _(and this is highly encouraged)_ copy the analysis and charts that someone else completed previously. This may be yourself, from 2 years ago.__

makes your analysis shareable
let's you email your analysis to someone else and they can reproduce it
reminds you what you did 5 years ago
your work is reproducible
steal other peoples' work in a community where that's OK = science
stand on the shoulders of giants, or small inconsequential state technical staff.

# 5| Original data doesn't change
go through the naming stuff
never worry about over writing an excel value


# 13| Missing values
do this when we summary()

# 6| Any plot for any data _ggplot2_

# 10| Automate it all!!
up to where the explosion happens

>EXPLOSION!!!
>Bonus Easily update your analysis





# 9| Make maps and know where stuff is
where is that Fond Du Lac site again?



# 12| Online community + us
when we talk about let's all work together and stuff

## Join the R community
- #rstats Twitter
- R Ladies
- R Cat Ladies
- R Dog Ladies
- local R user groups


# 11| Great stickers ---> RCat Ladies and R Dog ladies
give out stickers at the end

# 14| It will complement you. library(cowsay)
our goodbye slide can be this

## Congratulations! 
You've completed Superfast R Intro. 
You are ready for Day 1 of R Camp.
